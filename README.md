# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The project is part of an internship task and uses the Kaggle dataset from the "House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques" competition.
